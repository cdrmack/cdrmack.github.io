<p>
I'm currently trying to enter the space industry and gather as much information as possible about the required skills needed to be useful in that sector.
</p>

<p>
I was able to contact an ESA employee and ask some questions about the industry as a whole and opportunities for software engineers with different backgrounds. I also explored multiple career sites from companies that work in the space sector and reviewed the required and desirable skills for software-related roles.
</p>

<p>
From what I found, Java is mostly used for Space Ground Systems, and C and C++ are used for onboard software. I also saw Python, Ada, Fortran and C# for some positions.
</p>

<p>
As one might expect, there are also expectations regarding scripting languages, databases, operating systems, version control systems, etc. Requirements differ depending on seniority and project type, but during this research, I also kept encountering "ECSS" repeatedly.
</p>

<p>
After some digging, I found that ECSS stands for the European Cooperation for Space Standardization. According to the official website, this is "an initiative established to develop a coherent, single set of user-friendly standards for use in all European space activities."
</p>

<p>
There are MANY standards there, but the good news is that I probably do not need to know them all and that I can access them for free.
</p>

<p>
Right now, I plan to get familiar with the following:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>E-10 (system engineering)</li>
<li>E-40 (software engineering)</li>
<li>Q-80 (software product assurance)</li>
</ul>

<p>
There are slides and recorded training sessions available on the official website. I might need to watch them all at some point.
